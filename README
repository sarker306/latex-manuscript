This work requires a decent xelatex distribution to be compile. Moreover, it requires the xelatexbengali package shipped with it.
For linux/MacOX, you can download TeXLive. For Windows MiKTeX is recommended.
After you have successfully installed any of the two programs, extract xelatexbengali.zip and install it correctly.
